## üìä **Dataset**

The **QuickDraw dataset** consists of millions of drawings submitted by users worldwide, each labeled with a specific category. The challenge is to train a neural network that can accurately recognize and classify these drawings despite variations in style and representation.

**Key Features:**
- A wide range of categories (e.g., animals, objects, scenes, etc.)
- Diverse user-submitted drawings with varying complexities
- A structured dataset for supervised learning with labeled examples
