# QuickDraw-CNN

This project, conducted as part of a university examination at Sapienza University, focuses on the construction and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the QuickDraw dataset. The primary objective is to leverage deep learning architectures to classify drawings from the QuickDraw dataset accurately.

## Dataset
The QuickDraw dataset comprises a diverse collection of drawings submitted by users worldwide. Each drawing is associated with a specific category, and the task is to train a neural network to recognize and classify these drawings into their respective categories.

## Neural Network Architectures

Two prominent neural network architectures have been employed in this project:

- GoogleNet: Known for its efficiency and performance, GoogleNet is a deep learning architecture designed to optimize computational resources while maintaining high accuracy in image classification tasks.
- ResNet: ResNet, or Residual Network, is characterized by its deep structure and addresses the vanishing gradient problem commonly encountered in training deep neural networks. It has demonstrated excellence in various computer vision tasks.
